How to Use This Document
------------------------
- Each entry references the page component (`src/pages/...`) so engineers can jump into code quickly.
- Paths listed mirror the sidebar navigation (`AppSidebar.tsx`). If you can’t reach a screen, confirm the current user role/feature flags.
- Additional micro-screens (dialogs, wizards) live under `src/components/**` and are not listed individually; inspect related page files for embedded components.
